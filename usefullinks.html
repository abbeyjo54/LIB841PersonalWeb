<p>What can you do to keep your child engaged with literacy this summer?  Here are some ideas!</p>

<UL><LI>Start a bird watching journal with your child.  Visit the local library, Amazon, or a website to learn about the types of birds in our area!  This helps integrate science and literacy in one fun family activity!  The public library will have resources available!</LI>

<LI>Read seed packets and start a mini-garden in your backyard.  There are tons of great websites for students to read and learn about caring for their plants!  Call the local extension agency to get resources or visit the public library!</LI>

<LI>Join the Greenup County Public Libraryâ€™s Summer Reading program!  Visit their website regularly to see all upcoming events or call your local branch for more information.</UL></LI>
