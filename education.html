<p>I am <b>very</b> excited to be a part of McKell Elementary as a Preschool Teacher. This is my fourth year teaching. I have a <I>Bachelors of Science in Early Childhood Education with a minor in Psychology</i> from Shawnee State University. <em>Go Bears!</em> I graduated with the highest honors (summa cum laude) and a 3.9 GPA. I am currently working on my Masters degree through Eastern Kentucky University. I hope to finish this degree within the next year. My current GPA is 4.0. I am also working with the Kentucky Literacy Grant as a member of KRA (Kentucky Reading Association). This grant works to provide great resources for early literacy. We have partnered with the Imagination Library and other great resources to provide our students with new materials throughout the school year. I have a passion for literacy and early childhood education. I am so excited to be a part of my school community! </p>
